							<div class="present-content">

								<p>La Jeteé takes place in the aftermath of World War III where, in a post-apocalyptic Paris, survivors live underneath the ground in the galleries of the Pallais De Chalot. Here the ruling scientists experiment with time-travel, attempting to send prisoners through time in hopes of rescuing the present. Their attempts thus-far have proven unsuccessful, as their subjects cannot withstand the mental shock of time travel. Eventually they settle on sending the protagonist (known only as “the man”) back in time, believing that the key to their success lies in his vague but obsessive memory of a woman he had seen on an observation platform from his pre-war childhood. He did not understand what had happened, but he knows he had seen someone die.</p>

								<p>Seeking to avoid their previous mistakes,  the scientists resolve to send the man back in time to where his memory is clearest. After ten days of attempted time-travel, images begin to fabricate in the mans mind of pre-war Paris: a bedroom, a field, children, birds, cats, graves. Sixteen days in, and images of the woman he had seen as a child form clearly, and she looks back at him. On the thirtieth day he succeeds in travelling to the pre-war period; he and the woman from his memory meet and form a romantic relationship.</p>

								<p>Their time together however, is short, and he is quickly brought back to the present. Having succeeded in travelling to the past, the experimenters attempt to send him into the far future hoping to find a solution that will regenerate their own destroyed society. Here the man is surprised to find the technologically advanced people of the future waiting for him. The meeting is brief, and though they are initially hesitant, they find that mankind cannot refuse to its past the means of its own survival. He is sent back to the present with a power-unit sufficient enough to re-invigorate human industry, though he realizes quickly his jailers do not intend to spare him.</p>

								<p>While the man sits in his cell his death seemingly unavoidable, he is approached by the people of the future who offer to help him escape to their own time. To their surprise, he refuses, and asks instead to return to the pre-war time of his childhood, hoping to find the woman again. He arrives at the observational platform and realizes that his younger self is likely there at the same time, though he is more concerned with finding the woman. He quickly spots her, but not before realizing one of the agents of the present has followed him and intends to kill him. In his final moments he realizes that the incident he had witnessed as a child, that haunted him since, was the moment of his own death.</p>

								<h1>WAR</h1>
							</div>

							<div>
								<p>La Jeteé was written and directed by Chris Marker, who was eighteen at the outbreak of World War II. Marker was illusive about his past and rarely granted interviews, though it is known that he participated in the French Resistance and various reports suggest that after the fall of Paris he joined the United States airforce as a paratrooper. La Jeteé was released in 1962 during the height of the Cold War when the Cuban Missile Crisis had only just been resolved. Nuclear war was at this time a very real threat, that combined with Marker’s experiences during World War II made La Jeteé a powerful statement about the potential future of mankind.</p>

							<div>
								<h1>TRAUMA</h1>
							</div>

							<div>
								<p>The core narrative element of this film is the protagonists obsession with a vague memory of his past where he witnessed a death later to revealed to be his own. In the post-war world, he is selected for experimentation precisely because of this memory and though it allows him to travel through time and ultimately save man-kind it also leads to his own destruction.</p>

								<h1>EDITING AND PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
							</div>

							<div>
								<p>La Jateé is unique as a featurette in that aside from one brief moment it is constructed almost entirely from black and white still photography. Thus, movement in this film is conveyed entirely through the editing of the different photographs together. Cleverly, Marker uses dissolves, fade-ins and fade-outs to provoke the feeling of time lapse in an otherwise still visual atmosphere.</p>

							<div class="production-header">
								<h1 class=>NARRATION AND SOUND</h1>
							</div>

							<div>
								<p>Aside from some brief moments of whispering in the background, La Jeteé’s story is told entirely through narration and sound queues. This in combination with the films use of photography and editing helps to provide a sense of distance between the viewer and the dystopian reality portrayed on film.</p>

								<h1>12 MONKEYS</h1>

								<p>In 1995 director Terry Gilliam, known for his previous work with Monty Python, released the film 12 Monkeys which draws heavily from La Jeteé. The film follows James Cole, played by Bruce Willis, who is sent back in time following a pandemic that wiped out the majority of the world population. While differing heavily from its inspiration, it follows the same general structure, with the main character being selected due to his strong memory of a tragedy he witnessed as a child.</p>

								<h1>SCIENCE FICTION</h1>

								<p>La Jeteé differs from many other science fiction films of the time, using time travel as a tool to drive the story forward rather than as a set piece to be marvelled at. Many science fiction contemporaries claim La Jeteé as an influence, claiming this film as a turning point in the genre.</p>
